  ;; remove all keybindings from insert-state keymap,it is VERY VERY important
  (setcdr evil-insert-state-map nil)
  ;; 把emacs模式下的按键绑定到Insert模式下
  (define-key evil-insert-state-map (read-kbd-macro evil-toggle-key) 'evil-emacs-state)
  ;; but [escape] should switch back to normal state
  (define-key evil-insert-state-map [escape] 'evil-normal-state))
